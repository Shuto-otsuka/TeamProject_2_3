* Cap on the reservoir's confidence (candidate count folded in so far) -
* shared between ReflectionRT.hlsl's raygen (which clamps the reprojected
* history's M before combining) and ReflectionReservoirSpatialCS.hlsl (which
* normalizes the final M into a 0..1 confidence signal for
* ReflectionDenoiseCS.hlsl - see that file's use of
* shader_resource_indices.reflection_.confidence_index_).
*
* This directly trades noise for responsiveness: the streaming RIS combine's
* probability of accepting a brand-new frame's candidate over the existing
* reservoir is ~1/(M+1), so at steady state (M == cap) the reservoir itself
* is an IIR filter with an effective time constant of roughly `cap` frames,
* independent of anything downstream (the confidence signal above only
* controls how much the SEPARATE SVGF blend adds on top - it does not shorten
* the reservoir's own memory). A lower cap converges slower per pixel (more
* visible 1spp noise survives longer) but tracks scene change - camera
* motion, moving reflected content - much faster.

* This is a biased simplification: a fully unbiased spatiotemporal ReSTIR

* current pixel, and for a specular lobe specifically would also need to
* reweight by how well the borrowed direction fits the CURRENT pixel's GGX
* lobe (its target function here is plain luminance, not a BRDF-aware one).
* Skipped here for the same reason GI's version skips it - see
* ReflectionRT.hlsl's call site comment: a target function that depends on
* the receiving pixel's own geometry drifts a little every frame under
* temporal reprojection, which turns the resampling DECISION itself into a
* new source of flicker/noise that outweighs the bias it would remove.
