*
* Cap on the reservoir's confidence (candidate count folded in so far) -
* shared between GlobalIlluminationRT.hlsl's raygen (which clamps the
* reprojected history's M before combining) and
* GlobalIlluminationReservoirSpatialCS.hlsl (which normalizes the final M
* into a 0..1 confidence signal for GlobalIlluminationDenoiseCS.hlsl - see
* that file's use of shader_resource_indices.global_illumination_.confidence_index_).
*
* This directly trades noise for responsiveness: the streaming RIS combine's
* probability of accepting a brand-new frame's candidate over the existing
* reservoir is ~1/(M+1), so at steady state (M == cap) the reservoir itself
* is an IIR filter with an effective time constant of roughly `cap` frames,
* independent of anything downstream (the confidence signal above only
* controls how much the SEPARATE SVGF blend adds on top - it does not shorten
* the reservoir's own memory). A lower cap converges slower per pixel (more
* visible 1spp noise survives longer) but tracks scene change - camera
* motion, moving reflected/bounced content - much faster.

/**
* Streaming RIS combine of two already-resolved reservoirs (Bitterli,
* "Spatiotemporal reservoir resampling for real-time ray tracing"): each
* input reservoir is itself an unbiased estimate over M samples with weight
* W, so its own RIS weight when folded into a bigger reservoir is
* target(sample) * W * M. Calling this repeatedly - once against the
* reprojected temporal history, then once per accepted spatial neighbor -
* accumulates an arbitrarily large effective sample count one reservoir at a
* time (see GlobalIlluminationRT.hlsl's call site). b_valid selects out
* disocclusion/off-screen/rejected-neighbor cases without a branch at the
* call site.
*
* This is a biased simplification: a fully unbiased spatiotemporal ReSTIR
* also re-verifies the winning sample's visibility/Jacobian against the
* current pixel. Skipped here - see GlobalIlluminationRT.hlsl's call site
* comment.
*
* A receiver-side target function (luminance * cosine at the receiving pixel,
* per Ouyang et al. 2021, see the Reference block above) plus a reconnection
* Jacobian were tried here and reverted: both terms depend on the receiver's
* position/normal, which drift a little every frame under temporal
* reprojection (rounding to the nearest previous pixel, small camera motion)
* even on a static surface. That turns the RESAMPLING DECISION itself - which
* candidate wins, not just its radiance - into something that flickers frame
* to frame, which reads as noise no denoiser downstream is tuned to absorb.
* Plain luminance has no such receiver dependency, so the decision is stable;
* the cost is the corner/narrow-interior brightening bias the omitted terms
* would have fixed. Reflection.hlsli's own reservoir makes the identical
* trade for the identical reason - keep them consistent.
