/**

* Read views of the ray-traced shadow SVGF chain (ShadowDenoiseCS.hlsl). These
* live inside ShaderResourceIndices (per-view constant buffer) because the
* editor and game views each need their own temporal-accumulation chain: the
* shadow signal is screen-space and per-camera.
*
* Two independent signal chains, directional_/punctual_, because they are no
* longer the same shape: directional_ is still a single scalar visibility
* (moments/variance are one channel), while punctual_ is now ShadowRT.hlsl's
* ReSTIR-picked light's full BRDF RGB radiance (already visibility-weighted),
* whose variance is tracked from its luminance only (moments/variance stay one
* channel, but the signal itself is RGB) - see ShadowDenoiseCS.hlsl. Both
* share ONE geometry chain (history_length_/depth_normal_ below) because the
* temporal reprojection validity test is purely geometric (view depth/normal),
* identical for both signals at a given pixel.
*
* Within each signal chain, history_/accumulated_ are the SVGF feedback tap
* (ATrousPass2's output), i.e. what next frame reprojects, NOT the final image
* - directional_visibility_/punctual_radiance_ is the fully filtered result
* ATrousPass3 writes (see the UAV denoised_ fields below) and
* DeferredLightingPS.hlsl samples. moments_ carries (1st, 2nd) of that chain's
* luminance, history_length_ the shared accumulated frame count, and
* depth_normal_ the shared packed copy of this frame's view depth / depth
* derivative / normal, which the temporal consistency test needs from the
* PREVIOUS frame (the engine's G-Buffer is single-buffered, so it cannot be
* read back).
*
* moments_/history_length_/depth_normal_ all ping-pong exactly like history_/
* accumulated_ do; the atrous_scratch0_/atrous_scratch1_ pairs are pure
* scratch registered once in Create()/Resize().
